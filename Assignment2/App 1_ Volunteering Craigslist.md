1. An app the leverages the website I am making in CS401 for that connects potential volunteers and students to local organizations trying to get help. Imagine being able being able to pull up a map of volunteer opportunities nearby and be able to help the community in under 30 minutes. Teachers and Organizations can use the app to help manage the required volunteer hours that many classes or programs require. Students can use the app to find an opportunity that suits their interests and time. 
2. 
	a. A list of local volunteer opportunities as posted by organizations on the home website. (network/internet to website POSTs and GETs or just direct access to Database). -10 hrs.
	b. An application page for different volunteer positions. (network/internet) -3 hrs.
	c. A map based view of nearby volunteer events. (GPS, database) - 10 hrs.
	d. Management page for teachers and organizers, so there would be users and user roles. (Database, internet) -12 hrs.
4. POINT and Golden Volunteer Opportunities. 
	-I can be focused on local events and working closely with organizations to ensure safety and remove potential dangers.
5. The intended audience is general populace looking to get involved with community service in the Treasure Valley area and organizers looking to expand their outreach and volunteer pool.
6. The price would be free because it wouldn't make sense to charge for a volunteer app. If costs needed to be covered for data and server it would be through donations or working with organizers.
