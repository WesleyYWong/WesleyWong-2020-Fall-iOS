1. If you're tired of "Trump", "Biden",  "Kanye", or "Florida" for the 10th time today but you want to keep up with other news then filter it out. Don't want spoilers for "Cyberpunk" , "Season 8 Game of Thrones" , or "The Bible" the filter them out. News Minus String will filter out stories and articles that you just don't need to see today while leaving the fresh, new information right at your fingertips.
2. a. Article Display (network/internet, figuring out how paywall works and if this is legal) - 10 hrs.
 b. Filtration (algorithms and wrestling with the ethical implications of potentially furthering echo chambers) - 15 hrs.
 4. Could not find news aggregators that also filtered out specific keywords, but there are news aggregators. This app would let you filter things, like if you don't want to know if Cyberpunk has the option to be a cyber cat(which would be totally amazing).
 5.  The intended audience is for people who are feeling an information overload from the news cycle but still want to be informed.
 6. The price would be free because 1. I'm not even sure I can do this legally. 2.If I charged I feel pretty confident I would be making money from just displaying other's work. It wouldn't be transformative of the articles in anyway.
