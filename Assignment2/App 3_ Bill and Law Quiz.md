1. One reason that our political climate and system is so strange right now is the lack of critical information about actual policies and laws. Instead most information comes from news and pundits spinning and interpreting statements and policies for us. This app will allow people to take 5 minute out of their day to learn more about local, state, and national bills and take short quiz and compete to be the most informed.
2. 
a. Laws and Bills Database (network/internet, database) -10 hrs.
b. Quiz functionality (information handling, database, touch screen) - 15 hrs.
c. Leaderboard (database) - 6 hrs.
4. TrackBill: Legislation tracker tracks legislation and has some limited readability of proposed legislations. I would like to add functionality to current laws and extract certain piece of information to generate quiz questions for people to learn.
5.  The intended audience is for young adults who want to get informed but don't have a lot of time or just like competing.
6. Free because it would make zero sense to make something like this cost money. We already have disenfranchisement from lack of polling places and unnecessary voter ID laws. Adding a price to learn stuff is not good. (Yes this app would run on a very expensive piece of tech).
