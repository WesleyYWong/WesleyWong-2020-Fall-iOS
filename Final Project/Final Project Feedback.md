# Final Project Feedback



## Requirements:

You’ll be graded on the following areas:

1. (1/3%) **Technology** - Implementing more technologies (Core Data, camera, location, web services, animations, sounds, SceneKit, HealthKit, CocoaPods, camera, location manager etc). The more the better. Since each app is different try to implement at least 3 major mobile technologies. If you’re unsure, ask!
2. (1/3%) **Creative** - The design of the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and general creativity of the app, the idea and the implementation. Go to [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create) for color scheme ideas.
3. (1/3%) **Originality** - How original is the idea, and the implementation. This is subjective, but if your app reproduces other apps, this will likely result in a lower grade for this area. Example: A restaurant finder is not very original, but a Boise restaurant finder for college students, with a bus schedule, may be more original. Also, the implementation of the app matters. 
4. **5 minute presentation** 15 point penalty for missing this requirement.

## Comments

- Tab icons look great. I like the multi-input UIAlert.
- I think there was enough technology but it would have been nice to get Alamofire working and have that feature.
- UI could use a bit more time. I like that you used the Adobe color picker. You can use https://pttrns.com/ to get some inspiration for better UI.
- I think overall it was pretty good. It does show you understood most of the concepts of building out mobile apps. I think if you were able to get everything working and spent a bit more time on UI and details then it would been a lot better. Great job overall!
